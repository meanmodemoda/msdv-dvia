## Assignment 2 - Visualize Quantitative Data

### Summary

Using the provided Air Quality dataset from [New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r), choose a criteria for categorizing the data set. The dataset provides quantitative details regarding location, time, measured value, etc, that are available as comparison vectors. 

### Process

For any data project, I always like to contextualize my data. I chose to zoom in on past 10 years PM2.5 data across five boroughs. The ups and downs of PM2.5 values only make sense when they are compared to the threshold of "healthy" or "not healthy" air. This is my first time using `d3.js`, I chose a grouped line chart.

### Credit
`d3.js` is quite challenging for a JavaScript beginner. Thanks to the following resources, I think I laid a good foundation of basic `d3` charts.
