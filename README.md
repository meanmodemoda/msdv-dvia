# Introduction

This is my course repo of Data Vis & Info Aesthetics for Data Visualization at Parsons' School of Design Fall 2021.

### Assignment 1: Visualize Time
I learned to use `p5.js` to animate 2D graphs to resemble the wobbly passing of time.

### Assignment 2: Visualize Quantitative Data
I learned to use `d3.js` to plot out my first trend line chart.

### Assignment 3: Visualize Qualitative Data
I leveraged my past machine learning knowledge to process 10 years of State of The Union Addresses and compared the similarity between each speech against the Declaration of Independent. I used `d3.js` to visualize the analysis.

### Assignment 4: Visualize Geospacial Data
I learned to use `GeoJSON` and `Leaflet` to plot out recent earthquate data.
